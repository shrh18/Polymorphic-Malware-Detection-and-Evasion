# Polymorphic-Malware-Detection-and-Evasion - Comparative Study of GAN Models for Generating Adversarial Network Attack Data

## Overview

This project explores the capabilities of various Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models in generating adversarial network attack data to evade conventional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). The study examines the effectiveness, advantages, and limitations of different GAN variants, including:

- **Basic GAN**
- **Conditional GAN (cGAN)**
- **Wasserstein GAN (wGAN)**

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this study are:

1. **Evaluate GAN Effectiveness**: Assess the ability of different GAN models to generate realistic and diverse adversarial network traffic.
2. **Compare IDS Evasion**: Test the performance of these GAN-generated attacks against various types of IDSs, including:
   - Signature-based IDS
   - Anomaly-based IDS
   - Hybrid-based IDS
3. **Identify Challenges and Limitations**: Identify common issues faced by GAN models, such as mode collapse, instability, and high data dependency.
4. **Discuss Implications**: Discuss the broader implications of using GANs for generating polymorphic adversarial cyberattacks.
5. **Propose Future Directions**: Suggest potential avenues for future research in this domain.

## Key Findings

- **Realistic Adversarial Traffic**: Some GAN models, particularly cGAN and wGAN, can generate realistic and diverse adversarial network traffic.
- **Model Limitations**: Basic GANs and some other variants suffer from issues like mode collapse and instability, which affect their performance.
- **IDS Evasion**: The study provides insights into how different GAN-generated attacks perform against signature-based, anomaly-based, and hybrid-based IDSs.

## Implications and Challenges

- **Polymorphic Attacks**: Using GANs for creating polymorphic cyberattacks presents significant challenges and poses a serious threat to conventional IDS mechanisms.
- **Model Dependency**: The effectiveness of GANs can be highly dependent on the quality and quantity of training data, as well as the specific architecture and parameters used.

## Future Research Directions

- **Improving Stability**: Developing methods to enhance the stability and robustness of GAN training processes.
- **Enhanced Evaluation Metrics**: Creating more comprehensive evaluation metrics to better assess the performance of GAN-generated attacks.
- **Advanced IDS Development**: Designing more advanced and adaptive IDSs capable of detecting sophisticated GAN-generated attacks.

## Conclusion

This study underscores the potential of GAN models in generating sophisticated adversarial network traffic capable of evading traditional detection systems. However, it also highlights significant challenges and the need for ongoing research to address these issues and improve the resilience of cyber defense mechanisms.
